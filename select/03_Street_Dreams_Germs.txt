I won't build my life on your demands 'cause
I get my truths from a higher command
I've put my dreams through a tougher test and
I'm pullin' mind from outta this mess

I've got street dreams together with plans
I've got street dreams chaotic new stands
I've got street dreams ultra magic mess
I've got street dreams you're gonna detest

I don't like the way the world's progressin'
God's on fire screamin' depressin'...yeah!
I want a future that's not in the past
I don't want your recycled trash... kill it!

[Chorus]

Mr. Bourgeois we're lookin' for you
We want our lives, we ain't got two
We're takin' the keys to the locked doors
The future is for us the past is yours
Give us feelings give us more than you've got
Give us everything, everything we want:

[Chorus]

Build me a world with nothing restrained
Give me a hand I guess I can't be blamed
If there's a drop to be bled then it's for me
Yeah! Everything / everyone for free!

[Chorus]
